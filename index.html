            <h3><b>Discover</b></h3>
            <p>
                <i>While Delhi’s iconic landmarks steal the spotlight, there’s a whole other side of the city waiting to be discovered. From the peaceful gardens of Lodhi Colony to the hidden alleys of Hauz Khas Village, there’s so much more beyond the usual tourist spots. My exploration took me through quaint little cafes, tucked-away art galleries, and charming markets like Sarojini Nagar, where the heart of the city pulses quietly away from the hustle. Delhi’s magic isn’t just in its monuments, but in the stories shared over cups of chai, the music of the local bazaars, and the warmth of its people. Every corner of Delhi tells its own story—one I’m excited to share with you.</i>

                Beyond the bustling streets and vibrant markets, Delhi reveals an enchanting side that often goes unnoticed. The Garden of Five Senses, with its manicured landscapes and tranquil ambiance, invites visitors to pause and reflect amidst nature's beauty. Meanwhile, Humayun's Tomb stands as a testament to Delhi's rich history, where intricate Mughal architecture meets the serene stillness of time. For those seeking modern escapades, the city’s rooftop cafes and lounges offer breathtaking views of a skyline that blends historical silhouettes with contemporary marvels. As twilight descends, Delhi’s streets come alive with shimmering lights, the aroma of sizzling street food, and the hum of stories exchanged over chai at roadside stalls. From the chaotic charm of Chandni Chowk to the calm refuge of India Gate’s lawns under the stars, Delhi embodies a world of contrasts—where every alley, monument, and marketplace resonates with the heartbeat of a culture that is both ancient and ever-evolving. It’s a city that doesn’t just tell stories but makes you a part of them, urging you to explore, experience, and embrace its multifaceted magic.
